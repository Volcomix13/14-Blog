## Description

This project was created to build a tech blog. This project also helped me understand SQL and express better.
The challenges I encountered were mainly learning how to create the correct routes and set up the dotenv file correctly.

3. Then you can close out SQM by typing command quit
4. Run command npm run seed
5. Run command node server.js, this will start the application by provising an active port
6. Open Insomnia and choose your express method (get/put/post/delete) followed by localhost:3001/api. You can add the route you wish to test by adding the name of the route after api. See example below.
